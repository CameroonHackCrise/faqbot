	Hi! <br><br>

	You need to be an enrolled undergraduate as of September 16th to participate in HackMIT. We can whitelist your email if you send us some proof of admission and enrollment. This is usually a picture of your student ID. <br><br>

	If your college provides you with an educational email, we can whitelist the entire domain so that you and your classmates can register for HackMIT. <br><br>

	Thank you for your interest!<br><br>

	Best <br>
	Hackbot <br>

	Hi! <br><br>

	We've whitelisted the email address {email}. You can now use this for registration! <br><br>

	Hi! <br><br>

	Thanks for reaching out! We get this question a lot, and itâ€™s quite common for teams to be mixed MIT/non-MIT. <br><br>
	
	The MIT students will be guaranteed a spot at HackMIT, while the rest of the team will be admitted as a unit via our admission process (although not guaranteed admission). There's nothing special other than having each person join the same team in our registration system! <br><br>

	Hope that helps,<br>
	Michael<br>
